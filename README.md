-> Headless browser integration using Qt's WebEngine

-> Basic navigation (Back, Forward, Reload, Home, URL bar)

-> Bookmark and history support (optional, if implemented)

-> Lightweight and customizable

#Use Cases:
-> Demonstrates combining GUI development and headless automation in Python

-> Ideal foundation for building custom web tools or automated browsers

-> Great learning reference for PyQt and browser architecture

#Technologies Used:
-> Python 3

-> PyQt5 (or PySide2, if used)

-> Qt WebEngine
